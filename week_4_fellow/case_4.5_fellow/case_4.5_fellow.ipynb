However, it can provide an interesting lens to look at specific countries and how they relate to each other. After looking at correlations like \"people in richer countries live longer\" it's tempting to make a causation link (e.g. \"if poorer countries raise their GDP, their citizens will live longer\"), but correlation is not the same as causation.\n",

    "To presenting data well, you need to constantly keep two things in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the correct way to visualize the data\n",
    "2. Make the story easy to understand by being careful with the presentation details such as titles and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you saw that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bar charts are good for basic analysis, showing how categorical variables relate to numerical variables. In very specific circumstances, pie charts can also be used for this when you are interested in relative vs. absolute sizes\n",
    "* Scatterplots are used to show how to numerical variables relate to each other, and are good for looking at correlations\n",
    "* Line charts are almost always appropriate to show how continuous data changes over time\n",
    "* Box plots are a great tool if you need to show more than a basic summary (such as an average), but you don't want to plot the full distribution of each variable (which can be cumbersome and overly detailed)\n",
    "\n",
    "You also saw how important it is to get all of the details right when presenting data. It's very common for people to use wrong or misleading labels, or to use titles that don't add anything to the visualization. Always be careful that you are using the correct units, and clearly labeling what these are, while using the title to summarize the message behind the data."
