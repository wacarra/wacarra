    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** Investigative reports about digital financial services (DFS) have found instances of bias in the mechanisms that determine who a bank should loan money to. In many parts of the world, financial services are typically accessed based on an algorithmic assessment of their credit history. However, these systems have historically excluded consumers who are financially marginalized through intersecting forces of oppression. For example, in the United States, African Americans are disproportionately denied home loans because of a legacy of policies and banking practices implemented decades ago that were designed to exclude Black individuals from home ownership (also known as [Red Lining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)). Beyond race or ethnicity, many other factors may contribute to unfair distribution of financial opportunities, such as an applicant's gender, location, or age. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you are a data analyst for a major credit bureau. Your organization is concerned that the data on which they have trained their assessment tools are leading to discriminatory outcomes. The company wants to know if their predictions have been inaccurate for specific subgroups of the population based on how their prediction of credit worthiness was correlated with protected categories (e.g., gender, nationality, age). The company believes that if you can find patterns in the dataset used to build their model that reflect long-standing unfair social determinants of creditworthiness, they can then rectify this to reduce their contribution to unfair outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your employer would like you to answer the following: **\"What are the hidden biases in our datasets used to train our credit risk assessment algorithms?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** This dataset includes information about individuals and their credit history (whether they had failed to pay their loans before, what other loans they had, etc.) The credit agency will train a model on this data to decide whether to approve individuals for a loan (we typically use something called [*classification models*](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-learning-basics-of-classification-and-main-algorithms-c16b06806cd3) for these tasks, which you will learn about in later cases). The model will predict whether the individual will default (stop paying the loan, which is a bad outcome). You can find more information about the dataset [here](http://www1.beuth-hochschule.de/FB_II/reports/Report-2019-004.pdf)."

    "\n",
    "The South German Credit dataset, widely used to build financial services prediction models, is indeed biased. Importantly, we concluded that in this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Women are underrepresented compared to men\n",
    "2. People under 25 are underrepresented compared to people over 25\n",
    "3. Foreign workers are overrepresented compared to domestic workers\n",
    "4. Caretakers with many dependents are underrepresented in comparison to those with fewer than 3 dependents\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that the dataset contained biases that were both historical and representational in nature, and that those two types of biases are intertwined. Historical (societal) biases, for example, may be the reason why underprivileged groups then become underrepresented in datasets. Thus, an investigation into whether or not the credit scoring algorithm your company uses contains biases is warranted. In fact, it is almost certain that the model will perform in ways that reinforce existing barriers for women and young people."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we learned about two common forms of dataset bias. When datasets are biased, models can become biased, especially if the dataset biases go undetected. We used data exploration techniques to understand the nature of the dataset and reason about how it might reinforce existing social biases. We learned how to perform background and domain research on our datasets to understand where the data is coming from, how it was generated, and what the social context of the data sample was at the time of collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, we practiced critical thinking and self-reflection as we completed this case. It is important that we as data professionals remember that we are social beings bringing our biases, preconceptions, and blind spots to our projects. We should incorporate ways to recognize and account for these biases in our project workflows."
