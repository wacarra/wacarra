    "### Structure of Dash apps\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, Dash apps are web applications consisting of components which use Flask, ReactJS, Javascript, and Plotly. The authors of Dash have made sure we don't need to interact with any of these components directly via these other frameworks, and instead we can interact with all of them using only Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Dash apps are composed of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layout**: This consists of the components that we use in our app (e.g. selectors, plots, HTML elements, div, etc.). The layout is composed of HTML components (`dash_html_components`) and Dash core components (`dash_core_components`). The layout is set using the `layout` parameter of the `app` variable and is a list of all the components that will render on the browser when we launch our Dash application. More specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **HTML components**: Allows us to use common HTML tags in Python such as `Div`, `H1`, etc. These are then converted by Dash into HTML for the browser. In addition, we can also pass various properties to the HTML components such as **style**, **className** and **id**. The full list of Dash HTML components is available here: https://dash.plot.ly/dash-html-components.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    * **Dash core components**: This group of components enables us to add graphs, sliders, inputs, tables, file uploaders, and more to our app using only Python code. Each of these components comes with its own set of parameters that can be configured to change the look, feel, and interactivity. The full list of Dash core components is available here: https://dash.plot.ly/dash-core-components. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactivity**: This is the cross-filtering of data whereby changing one plot changes other elements of our dashboard. We use Dash callback functions to make our app interactive; these functions take inputs from multiple sources and their output then changes other components of the app. This is similar to programming with Microsoft Excel: whenever an input cell changes, all of the cells that depend on that cell will get updated automatically. This is called **reactive programming**."

However, as you can see from Exercise 4, the resulting app does not look very pleasant to the eye and if we keep adding further functionalities and plots, our code will start to look messy pretty soon. Luckily, we can tidy the code of our app pretty easily by dividing the layout of our app into different files. For instance, let's take a look at the file tree of the `App` folder provided with the case:\n",

    "We have structured this file system so that all of the different parts of the layout of our app lie in the folder `lib`, some basic styling and figures lie in the folder `assets`, and the data used in the app is located in the folder `data`.
