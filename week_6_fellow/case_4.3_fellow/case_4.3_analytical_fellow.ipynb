    "This case gives you a relatively comprehensive walkthrough of an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** process on an unfamiliar dataset. You will learn how to systematically approach investigating an unknown dataset while maintaining a creative and open mind to search for insights. By the end, we hope you are confident with tackling datasets outside of a structured environment and appreciate the tremendous value a proper EDA process brings to any data science problem."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context**. Airbnb is an enormous online marketplace for everyday people to rent places to stay. It is a large and lucrative market, but many vendors are simply individuals who are renting their own primary residence for short visits. Even larger vendors are typically small businesses with only a small number of places to rent. As a result, they have limited ability to assess large-scale trends and set optimal prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb has rolled out a new service to help listers set prices. Airbnb makes a percentage commission off of the listings, so they are incentivized to help listers price optimally; that is, at the maximum possible point where they will still close a deal. You are an Airbnb consultant helping with this new pricing service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem**. Your initial task is to explore the data with the goal of answering the question: **\"What features are most relevant to the price of an Airbnb listing?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context**. We will use the publicly available and well-maintained dataset created by the Inside Airbnb advocacy group. We will focus on listings in New York City within the last year, taking advantage of larger datasets when there are important details to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows: we will (1) do basic data exploration by plotting distributions of key quantities; (2) introduce the concept of correlation to find the key features; (3) introduce the idea of interaction effects to correct for the effects of key features; (4) discuss how to iteratively generate hypotheses and choose data visualizations to support your conclusions; (5) look at one very specific type of interaction effect, the temporal effect, and how to correct for it; and finally (6) pull everything together to identify the key factors that affect the price."

We will learn how to deal with these types of complex relationships in future cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, you learned the following exploration process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, look at the distributions of the available variables to look for interesting patterns and/or outliers.\n",
    "2. Then, use a correlation matrix to quickly reveal the most promising candidate variables for further investigation.\n",
    "3. Using the various charts and plots at your disposal, investigate candidate variables in turn. Note which ones exhibit intriguing and unexpected correlations.\n",
    "4. Explore potential interaction effects for the variables exhibiting unexpected correlations. Suspected important interactions should be looked at directly with further plotting.\n",
    "5. Finally, take some time to carefully plot any interactions that you know to be important from domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be a bit daunting at first, but it is widely used by veteran data analysts and scientists and is extremely effective in most situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume this walkthrough was new to many of you, so there is a large amount of learning to digest here. We strongly recommend that you review this case again by yourself until each step seems logical. It is crucial that you feel comfortable with this EDA process as we move towards later cases. By using this process to iteratively generate hypotheses and investigate them, you can uncover great insight about what is going on without building a single formal model. Formal modeling will be discussed in future cases."
