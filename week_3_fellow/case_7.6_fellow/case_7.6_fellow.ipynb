    "This case will be focused on building the core mathematical foundations necessary for further study of data science. Up until this point, we have been focused on analyzing data from an *empirical* perspective - that is, working with tangible data points in Python. However, more advanced study of the data science arena (such as with hypothesis testing & inference, predictive modeling, and machine learning) often requires some *theoretical* background as well, where we work with abstractions of the truth that aren't completely bound by the data we have. This case will address both."

You have been asked to investigate some historical data from this company to clarify the characteristics of smokers as part of this project.\n",

    "There is a measure of variability that is very similar to the interquartile range, but possesses some additional important mathematical properties that make it useful for tasks beyond simple descriptive statistics - the **standard deviation**. The formula for the standard deviation is as follows:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What this term is doing might seem complicated, but it's not so bad. You first take each value in your dataset (that's $x_i$) and subtract the mean $\\mu$ from it. For instance, if the mean is 5 and $x_i$ is 11, then you have to subtract 5 from 11. You then raise the resulting number to the second power and repeat the process for all the numbers in your dataset. Then, you sum up all these values (that's what the Greek letter $\\Sigma$, uppercase *sigma*, means) and divide the sum by $N$, which is the number of elements in the dataset (we do this to make this quantity into an average).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why $(x_i-\\mu)$ is raised to the second power is because for values of $x_i$ that are less than the mean, this value is negative, so when you sum across all of these values, the negative values would cancel out the positive ones and give us zero! You can therefore think of the standard deviation as the average deviation from the mean to any point in the dataset, either to the left or to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the square root of the whole thing to bring it back to the same units that our dataset uses. For instance, if you have a dataset of people's heights, it makes little sense to have an average deviation in square feet or square meters, so you need to take the square root to have it in feet or meters."

    "## Probability theory and distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have been concerned with calculating statistical values which give insight into the data we already have; i.e. we have been taking a more *empirical* approach. However, we often have to be forward-looking and also predict the likelihood of future events, which is more *theoretical* in nature. We had a sampling of this in Exercise 4, but here we will talk more in detail about distributions and some of the basic theory around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were to plot the distribution of BMIs for the smokers in our dataset — that would give us a histogram. But a histogram is entirely based on a limited sample of past data, and doesn't allow us to directly make predictions about the general smoker population, *independent of our specific dataset*. To do this, we need a **probability density function (PDF)**, which is a theoretical construct that helps us compute the probability of where any randomly chosen smoker's BMI would fall, and which is not strictly beholden to the limits of our dataset (caveat: In order to use a PDF as an aid for inference, ie., to make general claims about a population using data from a sample, we need to pair it with some other techniques that make sure that the sample is representative of the whole).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we didn't say that the PDF can directly tell us the probability that a randomly chosen smoker's BMI would be exactly some given value; say, 30. The reason for this is because BMI is a *continuous* value rather than a *discrete* value; it can take on any decimal value, so the probability that a person's BMI is *exactly* 30 is pretty much zero. It's virtually guaranteed that what we think is a 30 BMI is actually a 29.99 BMI, or a 30.01 BMI, or even a 30.001 BMI. Either way, finding a person with a BMI of exactly 30 is like trying to find a unicorn."

    "### Area under the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, it makes more sense to compute the probability that a smoker's BMI lies within some range; say, between 29 and 31. The PDF is perfectly made for this - specifically, if we plot the PDF on a standard 2-dimensional coordinate plane (with an $x$-axis and $y$-axis), this probability is the area of the region that lies under the PDF and above 0 (the $x$-axis), with $x$ values between 29 and 31. For those of you familiar with calculus, this is called the **area under the curve**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting consequence of this property of the PDF is that the total area under the PDF and above the $x$-axis, with no limits on what the $x$ values can be, has to be 1 (because the probability of an event has to lie between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous distributions is the **normal distribution**, for which the mean, median, and mode are all equal and which is symmetric around the median. This distribution has a high peak in the center and tapers off as we move towards the left and right ends."

    "From our analysis, we have seen that smokers pay substantially higher fees than non-smokers. Fees for smokers are also strongly correlated with BMI, particularly above the threshold for obesity. It seems that smoking is more common in males than females and that it is particularly prevalent in the Southeast region, which could account for the higher median charge in that region."

    "\n",
    "In this case, you saw that we can analyze historical data to understand the trends within it, and use those trends and some theoretical understanding of probability and statistics to predict the likelihood of future events. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summary statistics can be used to quickly indicate where the \"center\" of a dataset is, or how spread out the dataset is.\n",
    "3. We can investigate correlations between variables. This is especially useful during exploratory data analysis, and when (as you will see in future cases) building models that predict the value of one variable of interest based on several others.\n",
    "3. The probability density function is what allows us to move from the fully empirical world of histograms, which are an imperfect and limited representation of the entire population, to modeling and inferring characteristics of that population. The area under the PDF and above 0 between two specific $x$-values $a$ and $b$ gives the probability that a randomly chosen sample from that population will have an $x$-value for that variable between $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "4. The normal distribution is a particularly special PDF which is perfectly symmetric and with its mean, median, and mode all equal, and is a pretty good fit to many natural phenomena."
