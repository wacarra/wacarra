    "Excel is a wonderful introductory tool to the world of data science & analytics. While it is ultimately not as flexible or powerful as programming-centered tools such as Python, Excel is very good for general data exploration, analysis, and some data manipulation and reporting. Many times, it can be much quicker to find some data in an Excel sheet than it would be to find it using a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, it's also important to understand the limitations of Excel - once you start building multi-sheet files with numerous complex formulas and a couple of VBA macros, it's probably time to start thinking about moving on to more powerful tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following several cases, we will investigate how to use Excel for these particular use cases. For this case, we will learn how to do the basics of data exploration - finding the data we want and summarizing it so we can understand it better.\n",

In a single Excel file, you can find several **sheets** , each with its own set of rows and columns. Excel has a limitation of 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns per sheet, so keep this in mind in case you ever want to work with very large datasets.\n",

Note how we start our range in column H since it is the one that contains player IDs. We end it in column K because it contains player names, but we could end it in any other column after K as well in case we wanted data that is farther to the right.\n",

    "1. Filters (to help us manually go to the data we need)\n",
    "2. `VLOOKUP` and `HLOOKUP`\n",
    "3. `INDEX` + `MATCH`\n",
    "4. (Occasionally) `INDIRECT` or `CHOOSE`\n",

    "We also learned about applying aggregation functions to our data in order to extract more meaning out if it (with functions such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, or `COUNT`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cases we will learn more about data transformation of text, using functions such as `CONCATENATE` or `RIGHT/LEFT`. And finally, we will see how we can better *summarize* and *visualize* our data with charts, pivot tables, and pivot charts."
